<p>It would be remiss of me to commence this study with any chicken shop other than KFC, as its globally recognisable brand and ensuing ubiquity throughout the UK make it the perfect benchmark against which to judge other, more local chicken outlets. Before we begin it should be noted that I am not that great a fan of KFC. I find the coating too lumpy and frequently insufficiently crispy, while the chicken inside is texturally often rather slimy. 
<br>
Of the chips, there is little to say; save that they tend to require extra salting. They are acceptable fries, not soggy but also not eliciting any true excitment. 
<br>
The beverage selection is that which is to be expected in most national fast food chains, KFC have erred on the side of Pepsi rather than Coke and as such ones opinions on this matter will vary based on personal cola preference. I find myself somewhat on the fence of the whole affair. 
<br>
The sauces I have experienced at KFC are ketchup (Heinz -as it should be) and BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce is average, a bit sweet. +1 for the availability of gravy as a condiment at KFC. </p>
