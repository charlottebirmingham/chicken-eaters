<h1>ChickenEaters</h1>

<h2>Vital information about chicken for eaters of chicken</h2>
<p>I will be judging each chicken shop from which I purchase delicious chicken against the benchmark of multinational chicken purveyor KFC. I will be measuring the quality of each based on the following criteria<p>
<ul>
<li>2 Pieces of Chicken</li>
<li>Wings of any number(not BBQ)</li>
<li>Fries</li>
<li>Sauces - BBQ and Ketchup mainly, with occassional special mentions. Mayo will not be considered as it is a monstrosity, a crime against food etc, etc (unless it is garlic mayo, in which case all is forgiven)</li>
<li>Drinks - one can tell a great deal about a person (chicken shop) by the selection of beveages on offer.  
</ul>
